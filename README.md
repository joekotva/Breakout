    Breakout Project Overview

This is modeled off the standard "Breakout" game, in which a player 
controls a paddle that is used to bounce a ball in a 2D confined space.
When the ball collides with a brick, the player scores points.

In this version, the game is designed as a 2-player game, in which each 
player controls their own paddle to hit their own ball. Each game has a 
time limit, and at the end of that time limit, whoever has scored the 
most points wins.

Game was made with UnityEngine. The logic for the gameplay are scripts
